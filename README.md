# A statically generated interactive gallery using Next.js and Sanity

This example showcases an image gallery using Next.js's [Static Exports](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports) feature using [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) as the data source.

Originally based on [Blog Starter Kit with Sanity](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/blog-next-sanity).

## Demo

# Why

An exhibition designer may come across situations for which traditional in-gallery labels or space are insufficient.  The Whitney's Collection installation uses graphic label guides to help visitors find objects, while MoMA's Page Turners showcase additional exhibition material.

This prototype demonstrates how one could use a CMS (in this case, Sanity) with Next.js to statically generate a web-based interactive gallery experience.  The static build files could then be deployed to an in-gallery touchscreen display such as an iPad in kiosk mode.

# Configuration

## Step 1. Run Next.js locally in development mode

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```

```bash
yarn install && yarn dev
```

Your gallery should be up and running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)!

Note: This also installs dependencies for Sanity Studio as a post-install step.

## Step 2. Set up the environment

```bash
npx vercel link
```

Download the environment variables needed to connect Next.js and Studio to your Sanity project:

```bash
npx vercel env pull
```

Build the project:

```bash
npm vercel build
```

Deploy the prebuilt project:

```bash
npx vercel deploy --prebuilt
```
